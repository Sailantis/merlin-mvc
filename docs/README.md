# Azera Framework Documentation

The full Azera framework reference, organised by topic. Start with
**Getting Started** if this is your first time using Azera, or jump
straight into the area you need.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started](00-GETTING-STARTED.md) — Install Azera, set up a
  project, write your first controller, model, view and CLI task.

## Core Concepts

- [Architecture](01-ARCHITECTURE.md) — How `AppContext`, the MVC layer,
  the database layer and the CLI layer fit together.
- [MVC Routing](02-CORE-ROUTING.md) — `Router`, named routes, parameter
  validation, route groups and middleware.

## Controllers & Views

- [Controllers & Views](03-CONTROLLERS-VIEWS.md) — Action methods,
  dependency injection, view rendering, layouts and partials.
- [Clarity Template Engine](03b-CLARITY-ENGINE.md) — The template engine
  Azera uses by default: `.clarity.html` syntax, filters, inheritance,
  extensions.

## Data Layer

- [Models & ORM](04-MODELS-ORM.md) — Active Record, queries, state
  tracking, read/write connections and `ModelMapping`.
- [Database Queries](05-DATABASE-QUERIES.md) — The unified query builder
  for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.

## HTTP & Validation

- [HTTP Request](06-HTTP-REQUEST.md) — Accessing GET, POST, headers and
  uploaded files in a controller.
- [Validation](07-VALIDATION.md) — Fluent field rules, type coercion and
  error collection.

## Operations

- [CLI Tasks](08-CLI-TASKS.md) — Building `*Task` classes, option parsing
  and the `model-sync` built-in.
- [Security](09-SECURITY.md) — CSRF, password hashing and authenticated
  encryption with `Azera\Crypt`.
- [Logging](10-LOGGING.md) — Event-based logging hooks for the database
  and the application.
