# 🔌 Interface: TableResolver

**Full name:** [Azera\Db\Resolver\TableResolver](../../src/Db/Resolver/TableResolver.php)

Resolves a logical model/table name into a concrete source descriptor.

This is the single seam between the query builder and the data layer.
Implementations decide what a name like `User` or `users` means —
whether it maps to a real model class, a virtual mapping entry, or
a literal table name.

The resolver is also the single source of truth for hydration: when
`modelClass` is non-null, the query builder passes it to `ResultSet`
so that `FETCH_CLASS` hydration is available. When it is null, only
fast array/object fetching is available.
