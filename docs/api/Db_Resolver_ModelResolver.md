# 🧩 Class: ModelResolver

**Full name:** [Azera\Db\Resolver\ModelResolver](../../src/Db/Resolver/ModelResolver.php)

Resolves logical names as fully-qualified model class names.

If the name is an existing class that extends [`Model`](Core_Model.md), the resolver
instantiates it (cached per class) and returns the model's `source()`,
`schema()`, read/write roles, and `idFields()`. This enables `FETCH_CLASS`
hydration via the returned `modelClass`.

If the name is not a valid model class, a [`ResolveException`](Db_Resolver_ResolveException.md) is thrown.
This preserves typo detection — `table('Userr')` throws rather than silently
falling back to a literal table.

The model instance cache is an instance property. When the `ModelResolver`
is registered as a singleton in `AppContext`, the cache persists across
RoadRunner requests. This is safe because `Model` instances are stateless
with respect to connections — `readConnection()`/`writeConnection()` resolve
fresh via `AppContext::dbManager()` on every call. Implementing
[`RequestScoped`](Lifecycle_RequestScoped.md) ensures the cache is cleared after every request in a
persistent worker, so no state leaks from one request into the next.
