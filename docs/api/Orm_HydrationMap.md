# 🧩 Class: HydrationMap

**Full name:** [Azera\Orm\HydrationMap](../../src/Orm/HydrationMap.php)

Builds the hydration plan for a joined entity read.

The plan is a list of entries (root first, then one per requested to-one
relation) and a list of second-query specs for requested to-many
relations. Every entry maps FIELD names to generated SQL column aliases
({alias}__{column}), which is what makes one flat row hydratable into
several classes without collisions.

Pure function of (class, relation names) — cheap to rebuild, cacheable
later alongside metadata.
