# 🧩 Class: Advised

**Full name:** [Azera\Aop\Advised](../../src/Aop/Advised.php)

Class-level marker attribute that opts a class into AOP proxy generation.

The [`ProxyFactory`](Aop_ProxyFactory.md) uses this as a fast-path check: if a class
does NOT have this attribute, no proxy is created and the raw object
is returned with zero overhead. This avoids scanning every method
of every class for advice attributes.

Place on any class that has methods with advice attributes:

<code>
#[Advised]
class BillingService
{
    #[Transactional]
    public function chargeSubscription(Account $a): void { ... }

    #[Cache(ttl: 300)]
    public function loadProfile(User $u): Profile { ... }
}
</code>
